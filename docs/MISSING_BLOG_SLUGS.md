# Missing Blog Posts to Create in Sanity

The following slugs were redirecting to 404 pages because the content does not exist in Sanity.
Please create new posts in Sanity Studio with these exact **Slug** values:

1.  `how-genai-is-changing-the-landscape-of-automation`
2.  `genai-content-marketing-crwating-content-at-scale`
3.  `creating-an-omnichannel-strategy-with-genai-marketing-automation`
4.  `genai-automation-tools-for-seamless-content-marketing`
5.  `creating-compelling-campaigns-with-genai-content-marketing`
6.  `ai-driven-customer-experiences`
7.  `increase-awareness`

**Note:** The API/Code handles the redirect to `/blog/[slug]`, but you must manually add the Title, Body, and Image in Sanity for these pages to load content.
